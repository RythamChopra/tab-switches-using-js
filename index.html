          Let me explain you how this project functionality was made.

          <div class="btn-container">
            <button class="tab-btn active" data-id="history">HTML</button>
            <button class="tab-btn" data-id="vision">CSS</button>

              <h4>html</h4>
              <p>
                We have created a section where one div holds the title and the paragraph above , the second div holds 2 article tags where the first one has 
                the image and 2nd article tag holds 2 divs . One div for containing the buttons and the 2nd div for containing the information you are currently reading.
                The information about the CSS and JS is hidden because I am using the "active" feature currently and so that's why I am the first thing you see when visiting this page.
                Now you can check my fashion designer , CSS.

              <h4>CSS</h4>
              <p>
                Hi ! I am CSS , I am very lengthy to explain it to you but every design you are seeing like the fonts , the images , the buttons , the information ,
                the animation , all has been beautified by me . The HTML data holds a few class in their divs , sections and article tags which I have specifically selected 
                to add beauty and  animation , so the page looks visually appealing . Now you can check JS , he's the mastermind . 
              </p>
            
            </div>
            <!-- end of single item -->
            <!-- single item -->
            <div class="content" id="goals">
              <h4>JS</h4>
              <p>
                The reason you can switch between ME , HTML and CSS is because I am using "Event Targeting". Every button has a DataSet Id. 
                So everytime you click on one of us, the DataSet Id is recognised, then we use "classList" to toggle and remove the "active" feature from the currently
                displayed HTML information to the information you then clicked on . 
              </p>
